### Form Validation Logic
```javascript
// Email validation using regex
const emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;

// Name validation (2-50 characters, letters only)
const namePattern = /^[a-zA-Z\s]{2,50}$/;

// Message validation (10-1000 characters)
// Real-time character counter with color-coded warnings
```

- **Tablet (‚â§768px)**: Single column layout with stacked sections
- **Mobile (‚â§480px)**: Optimized spacing and touch-friendly form elements

### Dark Mode Implementation
